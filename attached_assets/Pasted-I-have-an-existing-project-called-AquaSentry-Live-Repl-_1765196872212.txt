I have an existing project called AquaSentry Live (Repl-AI). It already contains:
- A working backend (FastAPI-like) inside /backend
- Services like tank_service, map_service, maintenance_service
- Frontend pages: dashboard.html, map.html, alerts.html, maintenance.html, recommendations.html
- A working map using Leaflet
- Maintenance scheduling system
- Tank alerts, recommendations, and authentication
- Static tank data with fields like pH, turbidity, temperature, level, days_since_cleaned, etc.

I want you to ADD NEW FEATURES to this EXISTING project, without breaking any current functionality or UI.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. DO NOT rewrite existing code.
2. ONLY extend the project with new AI + Govt-impact features.
3. Use Gemini API for AI features (Vision, Text, Prediction).
4. Follow the folder structure exactly.
5. Create new routes in /backend/main.py or services folder only.
6. Add new JS modules in /frontend/js only.
7. Add minimal UI components inside existing pages – do NOT redesign entire UI.

ADD THE FOLLOWING 10 FEATURES EXACTLY:

1. AI Water Quality Prediction (24–48 hr forecasting) using Gemini.
2. AI Leakage/Overflow Detection using anomaly detection + Gemini.
3. AI Predictive Maintenance Scheduler with recommended cleaning date.
4. AquaCopilot: An AI chatbot using Gemini for officer queries.
5. Vision AI Water Contamination Detection (image upload → analysis).
6. GIS Ward-Level Heatmaps (GeoJSON layer support).
7. Rainwater Harvesting & Overflow Utilization Predictor.
8. Water Demand Forecasting (LSTM or Gemini-based).
9. Explainable AI Alerts (show cause + recommended action).
10. Offline-first PWA mode for rural deployment.

For each feature, generate:
- Required Python backend code (FastAPI endpoints)
- Required service functions (AI logic using Gemini)
- Required frontend HTML/JS additions
- Minimal CSS if needed
- API contract: input/output schema
- Integration instructions for existing pages

Also generate:
- A new API route summary table
- Updated architecture diagram (ASCII)
- A short explanation of how each feature helps Indian Government use cases

Ensure all code is 100% compatible with the existing Repl-AI zip structure.

Output everything as perfectly copy-paste ready.
